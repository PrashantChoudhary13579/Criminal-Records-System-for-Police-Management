# Criminal-Records-Management-System

This system is made by me as a DBMS project.

Description-
I created a user-friendly system using Oracle APEX to make managing criminal records easier for police departments. The system helps record and retrieve important details about police stations, officers, criminals, and FIRs efficiently. Itâ€™s designed to simplify day-to-day tasks with an intuitive interface, making data entry and searches quick and hassle-free while improving overall operational efficiency.
